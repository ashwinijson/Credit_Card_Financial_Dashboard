## Purpose & Objective:
The goal of this project was to create a weekly and quarterly reporting dashboard that helps
management track customer spending patterns, analyses behavior across demographics, and monitor
revenue performance. I built this dashboard to answer real business questions such as:
- Who are our top spending customer groups?

- Which states or segments bring in most revenue?

-  How are weekly revenues performing?

##  Business challenges I identified while working on it, noticed several gaps:
- The raw data came in inconsistent formats (dates, duplicates, blanks).

- There was no single view combining customer and credit card data.

- Management needed a weekly-level drilldown but didn’t have one.

## Key Deliverables

- Clean SQL dataset (after removing duplicates & fixing dates)

- Two interactive Power BI dashboards

- Weekly KPIs and revenue metrics

- A clean ERD and functional documentation

Insights Delivered

## Tables Used:
- Customer Table
- Credit Card Table

## Relationship:
- Client Number → Client Number (1:1)
- This clean relationship helped me successfully merge demographic and transaction-level insights, and it made the entire reporting flow smoother and more accurate.


## PERSONAL NOTE (My Contribution & Experience)

- While working on this project, I personally dealt with multiple challenges unstructured data,
date formatting issues, duplicate values, and slow visuals. I used a mix of SQL queries,
command prompt imports, and multiple test iterations in Power BI to get everything right.
- I also took the lead in identifying KPIs, discussing them with the team, and making sure the
dashboard tells a clear story.
- This project really strengthened my data modeling, SQL, DAX, and storytelling skills, and it’s
one of the reasons I feel confident taking on analytical roles.
